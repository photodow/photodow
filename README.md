### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is James Dow, and I am a web designer & developer. I work at the intersection of both design and development. Starting with design, I work with teams to design user-centric experiences using design thinking, and various design tools such as Figma and Adobe. Then while guiding it through the process, I start to build early with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and various other frameworks and libraries like ReactJS towards a production web app.
